You know how you use the Google Calendar but you hate yourself a little bit because the UI is kind of ugly and hasn't been updated in about 5 years? Wouldn't you wish it was flatter and nicer and has less shit?
Cool, me too.

I think the choice is clear.

## How to get it
You can install the extension from the Chrome Web Store, or install it locally as an unpacked extension:
 1. Clone this repo somewhere
 1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
 1. Make sure the `Developer mode` checkbox is checked
 1. Click `Load unpacked extension...`, and navigate to the folder that you cloned
 1. Refresh any Google Calendar pages you have open
 1. ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°
