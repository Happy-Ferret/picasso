You know how you use the Google Calendar but you hate yourself a little bit because the UI is kind of ugly and hasn't been updated in about 5 years? Wouldn't you wish it was flatter and nicer and has less shit?
Cool, me too.

I think the choice is clear.

## How to get it
You can install the extension from the Chrome Web Store, or install it locally as an unpacked extension.
